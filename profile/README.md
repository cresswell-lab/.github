# Welcome to the Cresswell lab Github page!

## Who are we?

Our team focuses on Cancer Evolution and Genomics in paediatric cancer. We are based at the St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute in Vienna, Austria since June 2023. You can find more information [here](https://ccri.at/research-group/cresswell-group/).

## What do we do?

We are interested in how childhood cancers evolve and we study this using genomics approaches (e.g. whole genome sequencing). We are particularly interested in large chromosomal alterations in paediatric cancers that are often generated by chromosomal instability. This instability creates a fuel that can drive cancer evolution forward and also generate diversity in a cancer population. We believe this is important in many cancers, including paediatric cancers.

## What can you find here?

We use our lab's GitHub page to track our own code and eventually publish tools and code related to manuscripts. As we further develop our code and analysis, more and more repositories will become available publicly.

## How to get in touch?

You can contact George directly at george.cresswell@ccri.at or for code related issues, please raise an issue.
